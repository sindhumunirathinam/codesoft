The system typically includes sensors placed strategically throughout the vehicle to detect unauthorized entry, movement, or tampering. When triggered, the alarm emits loud audible sounds and may also activate flashing lights to deter thieves and attract attention. Additionally, modern systems may integrate with smartphone apps or GPS tracking technology to provide real-time alerts and location tracking in case of theft.</p>
